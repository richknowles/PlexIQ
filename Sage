  ⚠️ Important Notes

  1. NOW DANGEROUS: Deletes physical files by default - permanent 
  deletion!
  2. Space actually freed: Files removed from /volume1/truenas/...
  3. The Untouchables: Starred movies CANNOT be deleted
  4. Password protected: Must enter plexiq2024 (or whatever you
  change it to)
  5. Backend is LIVE: Running at http://127.0.0.1:5000
  6. User control: Can uncheck the box to only remove from Plex
  (but why would you?)
