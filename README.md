# PlexIQ v3 🎬

**Smart Plex Media Library Management with Safety-First Design**

PlexIQ is an intelligent media library management tool for Plex that helps you analyze, organize, and optimize your media collection. Built with a safety-first philosophy, PlexIQ defaults to dry-run mode for all destructive operations and provides detailed analysis before any action.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities
- 📊 **Intelligent Analysis** - Multi-factor scoring system considering play count, ratings, file size, age, and quality
- 🔍 **Metadata Enrichment** - Integrates IMDb, TMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes ratings
- 🛡️ **Safety First** - Dry-run mode by default; explicit confirmation required for deletion
- 💾 **Automatic Backups** - All operations create audit trails and backups
- 🎨 **Dual Interface** - Full feature parity between CLI and GUI

### UI/UX Principles (Rules #1-5)

1. **Safety First** - Dry-run defaults, explicit confirmations, never delete highly-rated content
2. **CLI/GUI Parity** - Every CLI command has a GUI equivalent
3. **Clarity & Feedback** - Detailed logging, progress bars, and status messages
4. **Consistency** - Predictable interactions and patterns throughout
5. **Aesthetic & Delight** - Polished visuals with mustard-colored progress bars

## 📖 Documentation

### Configuration

PlexIQ uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required
PLEX_URL=http://localhost:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here

# Optional API Keys (for metadata enrichment)
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key

# Scoring Weights (must sum to ~1.0)
WEIGHT_PLAY_COUNT=0.3
WEIGHT_RATINGS=0.25
WEIGHT_SIZE=0.2
WEIGHT_AGE=0.15
WEIGHT_QUALITY=0.1

# Safety Thresholds
MIN_DELETION_SCORE=0.7
NEVER_DELETE_RATING_THRESHOLD=8.0
```

### CLI Commands

#### Collect Metadata
```bash
# Collect from a library with enrichment
plexiq collect Movies --enrich

# Collect without external metadata
plexiq collect "TV Shows" --no-enrich --media-type show

# Save to file
plexiq collect Movies --output movies.json
```

#### Analyze Items
```bash
# Analyze and show all items
plexiq analyze Movies --show-all

# Show only recommended deletions
plexiq analyze Movies --show-recommended

# Limit results
plexiq analyze Movies --limit 20

# Output formats
plexiq analyze Movies --format table
plexiq analyze Movies --format report
plexiq analyze Movies --format json
```

#### Delete Items
```bash
# Dry-run (default - NO actual deletion)
plexiq delete Movies --dry-run

# ACTUAL deletion (requires confirmation)
plexiq delete Movies --execute --confirm

# Use custom threshold
plexiq delete Movies --min-score 0.8 --execute
```

#### Backup Management
```bash
# List backups
plexiq backup list

# Filter by type
plexiq backup list --type deletion_executed

# Restore a backup
plexiq backup restore backup_file.json

# Cleanup old backups
plexiq backup cleanup
```

#### Configuration
```bash
# View configuration
plexiq config

# Show secrets (use carefully!)
plexiq config --show-secrets

# Validate and test connections
plexiq config --validate
```

---

## 🎨 GUI Interface

Launch the GUI with:
```bash
plexiq gui

# Or with a pre-selected library
plexiq gui --library Movies
```

### GUI Features
- **Mustard-colored progress bars** for visual feedback
- **Context-aware right-click menus** (<100ms response time)
- **Real-time analysis** with background processing
- **Interactive tables** with sorting and filtering
- **Safety confirmations** for all destructive operations

---

## 🧮 Scoring System

PlexIQ uses a weighted multi-factor scoring system (0.0-1.0, where 1.0 = highest deletion priority):

### Factors

1. **Play Count (30%)** - Never watched = high score, frequently watched = low score
2. **External Ratings (25%)** - Low ratings = high score, high ratings = low score
3. **File Size (20%)** - Larger files = higher score (more space recovery)
4. **Age/Staleness (15%)** - Old + unwatched = high score
5. **Quality (10%)** - Lower resolution/old codecs = higher score

### Safety Rules

- **Never recommend deletion** if average rating ≥ 8.0/10
- **Minimum score threshold** (default 0.7) must be met
- **Detailed rationale** provided for every score
- **Backup created** before any operation

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Dry-Run First (Rule #1)
```bash
# Default behavior - NO deletion
plexiq delete Movies

# Explicit flag required for actual deletion
plexiq delete Movies --execute --confirm
```

### Automatic Backups
- Every operation creates a timestamped backup
- Backups include full metadata and checksums
- Configurable retention period (default: 7 days)

### Audit Trail
- All actions logged with timestamps
- Separate log files for each day
- Configurable log retention (default: 30 days)

### Protection Rules
- Highly-rated content never recommended (≥8.0/10)
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Detailed preview before any deletion

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Deletion Context
PlexIQ focuses on **Plex media files** (movies/shows). It does NOT delete:
- System files
- Plex database
- User data
- Configuration files

However, it CAN optionally manage:
- Media cache files
- Thumbnails
- Transcoding temp files

### Backup & Recovery
- Backups contain metadata only (not media files)
- Deleted media files are handled by Plex's built-in trash
- Review all recommendations before executing
- Test with dry-run mode first
